Here’s a so-called Euler-Venn-Diagram that shows (1) how many CJK character (a.k.a. ideograph, sinograph, tetragraph, …) codepoints in Unicode are considered ‘important for daily use’ (just under 10,000); (2) how many of those are used in each of the three important usage areas (i.e. Ⓒ for Mainland China (PRC without the Hong Kong and Macau SARs), Ⓙ for Japan, and Ⓣ for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau); and (3) how much overlap there is for each of these regions. The bars made up from sample characters in the lower part visualize the same data, but this time with bar heights instead of circle areas being proportional to numbers.

Just in order to stress it, a 'character’ in this chart is equivalent to 'a Unicode codepoint’, so for example 馬 and 马 count as two characters, and 關, 关, 関, 闗, 𨶹 count as five characters. Dictionaries will list 馬马 as 'one character with two variants’ and 關关関闗𨶹 as 'one character with five variants’, but that’s not what we’re counting here.

You can see at a glance that

* around 25%—one out of four—of all characters are common to all three regions;
* around 17%—one out of six—of all characters are unique to the PRC and Taiwan,
  respectively, while only 3% are unique to Japan;
* only 1% of all characters are uniquely shared by the PRC and Japan, the most frequent ones being 会来国学当内数声写将号参区. But observe that usage frequencies usually follow Zipf’s Law (quote: “the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table”); because of this, any one character near the top of a frequency ranking will appear vastly more often than any one near the bottom of the same list. As a result, although the outcomes of the PRC’s and Japan’s post-war efforts to simplify characters share but one out of a hundred character shapes, those shapes are still exceedingly often seen in daily life.
Of the three regions—Ⓒ, Ⓙ, Ⓣ—the Ⓣ region is the one with the most balanced shared usages, the other two regions showing greater relative differences between their subsets shared with zero, one or two of the other regions. In a sense, therefore, the Ⓣ region may be considered to be the 'most representative’ or 'most average’ one in terms of character usage.

Overview of Unicode CJK Characters by Regions

Shown here are (1) the numbers of characters deemed essential for general usage as reported by the ISO/IEC 10646 IICore initiative, consolidated into three regions: Ⓒ Mainland China, Ⓙ Japan, Ⓣ (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Korea). Circled capital letters show sum totals; plain lower case letters show partial sums for codepoints reported only for (possibly overlapping) sub-regions (e.g. ‘j’ for characters only used in Japan, ‘cj’ for forms used only in the PRC and Japan, etc). (2) For comparison, the three outer circles marked ❶, ❻, and ❽ show the growing number of CJK codepoints in Unicode through different versions.—All circles and overlaps are area-proportional to the resp. character counts; not shown is the small number of characters included in IICore, but missing from UCS V1.

Here's a so-called Euler-Venn-Diagram that shows (1) how many CJK character (a.k.a. ideograph, sinograph, tetragraph, ...) codepoints in Unicode are considered 'important for daily use' (just under 10,000); (2) how many of those are used in each of the three important usage areas (i.e. Ⓒ for Mainland China (PRC without the Hong Kong and Macau SARs), Ⓙ for Japan, and Ⓣ for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau); and (3) how much overlap there is for each of these regions. The bars made up from sample characters in the lower part visualize the same data, but this time with bar heights instead of circle areas being proportional to numbers.

Just in order to stress it, a 'character' in this chart is equivalent to 'a Unicode codepoint', so for example 馬 and 马 count as two characters, and 關, 关, 関, 闗, 𨶹 count as five characters. Dictionaries will list 馬马 as 'one character with two variants' and 關关関闗𨶹 as 'one character with five variants', but that's not what we're counting here.

You can see at a glance that

* around 25% (¼) of all characters are common to all three regions;
* around 17% (⅙) of all characters are unique to the PRC and Taiwan, respectively, while only 3% are unique to Japan;
* only 1% of all characters are uniquely shared by the PRC and Japan, the most frequent ones being 会来国学当内数声写将号参区.

天地玄黃 The sky was black, and yellow the earth
宇宙洪荒 space and time vast, limitless.
日月盈昃 Sun high or low, moon full or parsed
辰宿列張 with stars and lodges spread in place.
寒來暑往 Cold arrives then heat once more
秋收冬藏 Autumn's harvest, Winter's store.
閏餘成歲 Extra days round out the years
律呂調陽 scale in tune with sun and spheres.
雲騰致雨 Clouds soar up to end in rain
露結為霜 the dew congeals to morning frost.
